# Homework-1-What-We-Know-So-Far
# Introduction
I have been given the opportunity to refactor some code, so that accessibility standards are met and the site for Horiseon works. Below is some more information of what I experienced in carrying out this task.
## Why did I do this?
The homework was to use all the skills we have picked up so far to refactor the code of the Horiseon website. The reason for this was to meet the neccessary accessibility standards. In order for me to do this I had to use HTML and CSS, the code was refactored so that it worked, examples of what was done are : Semantic elements were implemented in the code so that it made more sense. The order of elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, as per the acceptance criteria. 
### What I learnt
I have learn't a huge amount so far, I have been able to use the knowledge I have picked up, to refactor the code successfully, so that it looks like the example given in the "Mock-Up". This was pleasing as it took a lot of hard work to fix the code. As well as reinforcing the use of Terminal to commit and push my work to the repository. The use of CSS helped a lot to re jig the site so it looked aesthetically pleasing. The Scout Rule was used, as I beleive I left the code better than I found it. 

#### For the future
I would do well to remember the different elements, which go together to successfully complete the homework. As they are major foundation upon which I will build on. For me to do this correctly with success, I need to keep studying, paying attention and practicing code so it sticks. Once I know more there will be many different ways I could approach refactoring the code for this Horiseon site so it is more accessible, which excites me.
